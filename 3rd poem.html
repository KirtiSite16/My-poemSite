  <h1>I Hate You, Because I Loved You Most</h1>
  <div class="theme">Theme: Conflicted hate born from deep love</div>
  <div class="poem">
I hate you, not with bitter flame,  
But with a love I couldn’t tame.  
A love so deep it cracked my core—  
And left behind a slamming door.

I hated you when silence grew,  
When smiles were meant for someone new.  
You never saw what burned in me—  
Too blind to what you’d never see.

I hate you still, this very day,  
For looking through me every way.  
For loving her with all your light,  
While I stood quiet, out of sight.

I do not know if hate will fade,  
Or if this wound is meant to stay.  
I only know I gave you all—  
And watched myself begin to fall.

You talk of her — your voice still sweet,  
But every word just brings defeat.  
Have you moved on? I’ll never know—  
But I can’t wait while time moves slow.

I’m tired of aching in the grey,  
Of hoping love might look my way.  
So here I stand, no longer true—  
I hate you most, because I *loved* you.
