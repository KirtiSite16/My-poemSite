  <h1>The Day I Let You Go</h1>
  <div class="theme">Theme: Letting go after knowing he loves someone else</div>
  <div class="poem">
I loved you once with all I had,  
In silent dreams, both good and bad.  
You were the name I breathed each night,  
The hidden hope, the fading light.

But then I saw what truth can do—  
That love you feel is not for me, but for someone new.  
And in that moment, sharp and clear,  
I stopped pretending you were near.

No longer do I chase your glance,  
Or wonder if I stood a chance.  
I stopped the care, the ache, the plea—  
What you feel now means naught to me.

I’ve learned that distance sets me free,  
And maybe, it’s what's best for me.  
So I’ll walk on, not out of spite,  
But toward my own, far kinder light.
