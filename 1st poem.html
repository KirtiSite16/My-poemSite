  <h1>The Quiet Between Us</h1>
  <div class="theme">Theme: Unspoken love, knowing he loves someone else</div>
  <div class="poem">
I love you, but the words get stuck,
Behind my smile, inside my luck.
You laugh, and I just look away—
How could I speak? What could I say?

You talk of her, eyes full of light,
While I dissolve into the night.
Each moment near you feels so wide,
But I’m just standing on the side.

I write your name in silent air,
A ghost of hope I shouldn’t wear.
You never knew, and never will—
My heart, it breaks but must stay still.

This love’s a room I cannot leave,
A quiet ache I cannot grieve.
  </div>
