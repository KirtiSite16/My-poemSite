        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
        <p>
            In <em>The Broken Heart</em>, I explore the many layers of love and loss—those experiences that shape us, fracture us, and ultimately leave us 
            standing in the ruins of what we thought we knew about ourselves. The poems in this book are not meant to offer answers, but to give voice to 
            the complex emotions that often remain unspoken: the ache of unrequited love, the sorrow of farewell, the vulnerability of reopening a heart 
            scarred by the past.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through these verses, I seek to capture the paradox of heartache—the way it can simultaneously feel like the heaviest burden and the most 
            profound revelation. There is a beauty in the brokenness, a quiet redemption that emerges from the fragments. It is my hope that as you 
            read these poems, you might find solace, resonance, and perhaps even healing in the shared experience of heartbreak.
        </p>
