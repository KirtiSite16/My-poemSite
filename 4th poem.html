  <h1>You Know, Yet Say Nothing</h1>
  <div class="theme">Theme: He knows you love him, but stays silent</div>
  <div class="poem">
I loved you—not in spoken breath,  
But in the hush where longing slept.  
In stolen glances, soft and shy,  
In every word I dared not try.

And still, you know. I see it there—  
That flicker caught in half-aware.  
You wear the silence like a shield,  
Afraid of truths the light might yield.

Do you love me? Or is she  
Still dancing in your memory?  
Am I just warmth you choose to keep  
While holding someone else too deep?

You say nothing, play the part,  
Yet echo answers in your heart.  
Are you too scared to break the calm,  
Or scared you’ll lose what’s in your palm?

I asked, in thoughts you’ll never hear,  
Each one a whisper dressed in fear.  
But I can't live on silent threads,  
Where love is felt but never said.

So I will not wait at your closed gate,  
Or stand beneath the weight of fate.  
I leave not void of love or grace—  
But with a soul that found its place.
