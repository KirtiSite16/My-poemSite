  <h1>Author's Note</h1>
  <div class="note">
These poems were born from the quiet spaces we often leave unspoken—the glances that linger too long, the words we almost say, and the love we carry in silence.

Each piece in this collection is threaded with the ache of knowing, of loving without return, and of letting go not because we want to, but because we must.

"The Quiet Between Us" was written during a time of emotional restraint—where love was present, but permission to express it was not.  
"The Day I Let You Go" came from understanding that love cannot grow where it is not nurtured.  
"I Hate You Because I Loved You the Most" explores the complicated bond between love and resentment.  
"You Know, Yet Say Nothing" speaks to the painful honesty of being seen but not chosen.  
"Maybe Later, Maybe Never" rests in the gray space of hope and hesitation, where the future remains untold.

These are not stories with neat endings. They are moments—unfinished, unresolved—but real. I hope they speak to your own silences and help you feel a little less alone in them.
