  <h1>Maybe Later, Maybe Never</h1>
  <div class="theme">Theme: Confused love, unsure future</div>
  <div class="poem">
I love you, and I asked you why,  
But your response was a quiet sigh.  
You said “not now, maybe later,”  
And it hurt more than any “no” could cater.

I didn’t want to hear the wait,  
Not knowing if I’d be too late.  
The words you spoke were soft, unclear—  
A promise made without sincere.

Do you feel love, or just confusion,  
Tangled in a silent illusion?  
Is it me, or is it someone else,  
That holds your heart and drives you to dwell?

I wait in silence, lost in time,  
Wondering if our stars will align.  
But waiting now is bittersweet,  
My heart unsure, my soul incomplete.

Maybe later, maybe never—  
I’ll wait, but not forever.  
I’ll hold on to the flicker of hope,  
But if it fades, I’ll learn to cope.
