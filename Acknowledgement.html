        <p>
            Writing <em>The Broken Heart</em> has been a deeply personal journey, and I am grateful to those who have accompanied me along the way.
            Thank you to the people who have loved me—whether briefly or endlessly—for showing me the depth of both joy and sorrow. You gave these poems life.
        </p>
        <p>
            To my family, for their constant support, and to my friends, who listened when I needed to speak—I am forever grateful.
            I also want to thank the poets and artists whose courage and creativity inspired me to open my own heart to the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            And finally, to you, the reader: thank you for being here. I hope these words hold a mirror to your heart and remind you that you are never alone in your pain—or your healing.
        </p>
